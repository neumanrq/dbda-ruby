# Doing Bayesian Data Analysis - Ruby edition

![dbda-dogs](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/_/rsrc/1403617861639/config/customLogo.gif?revision=5)

This repository contains some notes and example implementations of concepts mentioned in
the great book [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/)
written by John Kruschke.

As most implementations out there are writtin in Python or R, I'd like to make an experiment here
and give some examples written in Ruby.

Hints, feedback, corrections are welcome ✌️ Don't hesitate to open an issue or
even a PR if you feel I got something wrong.
